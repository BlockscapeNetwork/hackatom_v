# Marketplace Contract

This contract provides the functionality to trade cw721 nft tokens. To accomplish this the contract implements a *receive* function which acts as a counterpart to the cw721 *send* function. It also provides several functions for trading.

## Functionality

### Use Case 1: Buy NFT with FT

The first use case is to buy a NFT for a predefined (by seller) value.

### Use Case 2: Auction NFT

After simple buying is implemented, a function to auction the nfts could be implemented.

### Use Case 3: Swap NFT(s) for NFT(s)

For this version one or more NFTs are swapped with another or several other NFTs. This might be interesting for a trading card use case.
